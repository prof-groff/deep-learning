## AWS
http://aws.amazon.com

Amazon Web Services via their Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) allows users to create computer instances with both CPUs and GPUs attached to them. Free trial periods or promotional credits may be available for new users. Also, the is a free tier of services.

## Udacity
http://www.udacity.com

Udacity is an online training platform for data science, machine learning, software devleopment, and much more. Many classes or modules are available for free. 

## Kaggle
http://www.kaggle.com

Kaggle is an online community of data scientists. Users can create and share online Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts, and can run them in the cloud. Community members can also participate in data science competitions.

## FloydHub
http://www.floydhub.com

FloydHub is a cloud-base platform for building, training, and deploying deep learning models. There is a free tier with limited capacity.

## Google Cloud
http://cloud.google.com

Google Cloud allows you to set up and run computer instances in a similar fashion to AWS. There may be a free trial period and promotional credits for new users, and like AWS there is a free tier. But, there is no educator program like what AWS offers. 

## Microsoft Azure Notebooks

http://notebooks.azure.com

Microsoft's Azure service also allows user to create cloud compute instances. But, Azure also offers free online Jupyter Notebooks. This is a great service but has been somewhat resource contrained in the past.
